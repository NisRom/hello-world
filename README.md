# hello-world
Master repository of ideas and resources

I am a newbie to the world of data science and coding, but I have decided that I want to make it more of my home. my background is in public health and social science research, so while I am not new to data analysis, I have not explored the power of different tools and ways to give consistent and automated insights to programs and organizations.

I'm hoping to learn several new languages that will allow me to advance in my career and offer ways for programs/organizations to understand and use their data in the most meaningful way possible.
